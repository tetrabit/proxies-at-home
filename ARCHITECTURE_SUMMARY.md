# Architecture Review - Executive Summary

> [!WARNING]
> ## Historical architecture review — not current guidance
> This is a preserved 2024 review. Its findings, recommendations, metrics, deadlines, and status are historical records and are not newly verified or current instructions. In particular, do not follow its proposals for an undefined Electron strategy, registry publishing, or GitHub Actions.

> Use the current decision sources instead: [ADR-001: bundled Electron microservice](docs/ADR-001-bundled-microservice.md), the [local private shared-client contract](shared/scryfall-client/README.md), and the [self-hosted/manual automation policy](docs/DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md#cicd-policy).

**Date**: 2024-02-08  
**Status**: ✅ SOLID ARCHITECTURE  
**Grade**: **B+ (85/100)**  
**Recommendation**: **PROCEED WITH 5 TACTICAL IMPROVEMENTS**

---

## TL;DR

✅ **The architecture is fundamentally sound.** Microservice separation, OpenAPI-first design, and migration plan are excellent. However, 2 critical decisions must be made THIS WEEK, and 3 high-priority improvements should be added to Phase 1.

---

## Critical Issues (Must Fix)

### 🔴 BLOCKING (This Week)

1. **Electron Strategy Undefined**
   - **Problem**: No decision on how to bundle microservice with Electron
   - **Recommendation**: Bundle Rust binary (Option A)
   - **Owner**: Architecture Team
   - **Deadline**: THIS WEEK (blocks Phase 1)

2. **PostgreSQL in Electron**
   - **Problem**: 500MB RAM usage too high for desktop app
   - **Recommendation**: Add SQLite backend to microservice (`--features sqlite`)
   - **Owner**: Backend Team
   - **Timeline**: Phase 1 (+2 days)

### 🟡 HIGH PRIORITY (Phase 1 or Post-Launch)

3. **Client Distribution via File Reference**
   - **Problem**: Brittle, no versioning, path-dependent
   - **Recommendation**: Publish to GitHub Packages (npm)
   - **Timeline**: Phase 1 or post-launch

4. **No CI/CD Pipelines**
   - **Problem**: Manual builds, no automated testing
   - **Recommendation**: GitHub Actions for both repos
   - **Timeline**: Phase 1 or Phase 5

5. **SQLite Duplication**
   - **Problem**: 45K lines of redundant code in Proxxied
   - **Recommendation**: Remove in Phase 6 (already planned ✅)
   - **Timeline**: Phase 6

---

## What's Excellent

✅ **Microservice architecture** - Clean separation, scalable  
✅ **OpenAPI-first design** - Type safety + contract testing  
✅ **415 test files** - Comprehensive coverage  
✅ **Rust microservice** - 7.1MB binary, sub-50ms queries  
✅ **Technology choices** - React 19, Axum, PostgreSQL, Vite, Zod  
✅ **Migration plan** - Well-designed, QA-validated  

---

## What Needs Improvement

⚠️ **Electron strategy** - Undefined (CRITICAL)  
⚠️ **PostgreSQL in Electron** - Too heavy (500MB RAM)  
🔧 **File reference** - Should be npm package  
🔧 **CI/CD** - Missing automated pipelines  
🔧 **Dev experience** - Manual coordination, no single startup  

---

## Grade Breakdown

| Dimension | Grade | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Architecture fundamentals | A (95/100) | Excellent design |
| Implementation quality | A- (90/100) | Clean code, good tests |
| Operational maturity | B (75/100) | Missing CI/CD |
| Developer experience | B+ (85/100) | Good, minor friction |
| Documentation | B+ (85/100) | READMEs good, need ADRs |
| **OVERALL** | **B+ (85/100)** | Solid with improvements |

---

## Timeline Impact

**Original Plan**: 5-6 weeks (28-33 days)  
**With Critical Fixes**: 7-8 weeks (36-41 days)  
**Reason**: +2 days for SQLite backend in microservice  
**Acceptable?**: ✅ YES - Better to do it right

---

## Recommendations

### Immediate (This Week)

1. ✅ **DECIDE**: Bundle Rust binary in Electron (Option A)
2. 🔧 **PLAN**: Add SQLite backend to microservice (Phase 1)
3. 🔧 **DOCUMENT**: Create ADR-003 (Electron strategy)

### Phase 1 Additions

4. 🔧 **ADD**: SQLite support (`rusqlite` feature flag)
5. 🔧 **CREATE**: Electron lifecycle manager
6. 🔧 **SETUP**: CI/CD pipelines (or defer to Phase 5)
7. 🔧 **PUBLISH**: Client to GitHub Packages (or defer to post-launch)

### Phase 6 (Already Planned)

8. ✅ **REMOVE**: SQLite from Proxxied (eliminate duplication)

### Post-Launch

9. 🔧 **ADD**: Performance benchmarks (criterion + k6)
10. 🔧 **IMPROVE**: Dev tooling (single startup, CONTRIBUTING.md)

---

## Key Metrics

**Proxxied**:
- 45,347 lines TypeScript
- 415 test files
- ~50MB Electron bundle

**Microservice**:
- 2,696 lines Rust
- 7.1MB binary (release)
- Sub-50ms query times
- 1000+ req/sec throughput

---

## Decision Matrix

| Decision | Now vs Later | Impact if Deferred |
|----------|--------------|-------------------|
| Electron strategy | ✅ NOW | Phase 1 blocked |
| SQLite backend | ✅ NOW | Electron unusable |
| Remove Proxxied SQLite | ✅ Phase 6 | Tech debt |
| npm package | 🔧 Can defer | Brittle but works |
| CI/CD | 🔧 Can defer | Manual builds OK |

---

## Final Verdict

✅ **PROCEED WITH MIGRATION**

The architecture is **solid B+ (85/100)**. With 2 critical fixes (Electron strategy + SQLite backend) and 3 high-priority improvements (npm package, CI/CD, code cleanup), it becomes an **A- architecture** ready for production.

**Confidence**: HIGH (reviewed 48K lines of code across both repos)

**Next Step**: Team meeting to decide Electron strategy + SQLite implementation
